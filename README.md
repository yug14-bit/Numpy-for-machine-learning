# Numpy-for-machine-learning

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook covering **basic to intermediate NumPy concepts**
required for **Data Science and Machine Learning**.

The notebook is created as part of my machine learning learning journey and focuses on
practical usage rather than heavy theory.

---

## 📌 Topics Covered

- Introduction to NumPy
- NumPy arrays vs Python lists
- Creating arrays (1D, 2D, 3D)
- Vector, matrix, and tensor basics
- Array properties (`shape`, `ndim`, `dtype`)
- Reshaping arrays
- Indexing and slicing
- Boolean masking and filtering
- Sorting arrays
- `np.where()` usage
- Adding and removing elements
- Array compatibility and broadcasting concepts
- Basic NumPy operations used in ML workflows

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This notebook is designed to build a **strong NumPy foundation** before moving on to:
- Pandas
- Data visualization
- Scikit-learn
- Machine learning algorithms

---

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📖 How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open the notebook using Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab
3. Run cells sequentially to understand concepts with examples

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization
- Machine learning models using Scikit-learn
